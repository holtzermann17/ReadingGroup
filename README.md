 Notes from the 2019 Augment Peeragogy Handbook v3 reading group

# Style Guide

*This is a How-To Handbook.*

Keep it short
-------------

The easiest sections to read are those that are shorter and include some
kind of visual (video or image) and have some personal connection (i.e.
they tell a story). For anything longer, break it up into sub-pages, add
visuals, make sure each sub-page is accessible to someone (who is it?).
Think clearly of this reader, talk to them.

Make it clear
-------------

We’ll illustrate this point by example. The original full title of the
book was “The Peeragogy Handbook: A resource for self-organizing
self-learners”. But
“[self-organizing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organization)” is a
technical term, and “self-learner” is a confusing neologism. We
shouldn’t use technical terms unless we explain them. So we really
shouldn’t use it in the first sentence or paragraph, or title, of the
book because we’ll scare people off or confuse them. If we want to
explain what “self-organization” means and why it is relevant for
peeragogy, then we can take a chapter to do that much later on in the
book. At the same time, we shouldn’t try to “say the same thing in a
simpler way.” We should try to get rid of the technical concept
completely and see what’s left. The easiest thing to do in such cases is
to delete the sentence completely and start over: when in doubt, speak
plainly.

Don’t overdo it with bullet points
----------------------------------

Text can be very hard to read when there are more than a few bullet
points included. Numbered lists should also be used sparingly. It also
seems that when many disjointed bullet points appear, sometimes the
author is really just indexing the main points that are presented better
in someone else’s narrative. Therefor, consider replacing an entire
bulleted list with a reference to someone else’s book/webpage/chapter.
In today’s hyperlinked world, it’s easy enough for the reader to go
elsewhere to get good content (and indeed, we should make it easy for
them to find the best treatments around!). It is not very pleasant to
have to *read* a taxonomy.

Include activities
------------------

When reading, editing or otherwise working your way through the book,
please make note of any activities or exercises that come to mind, and
share them.  We’re always striving to be more practical and applicable.

Don’t be overly chatty
----------------------

In our efforts to escape from academia-speak and simplify the text in
the handbook, it’s important to make sure we are not heading towards the
other extreme – being too conversational. When we’re having a
conversation with someone, we tend to pepper our ideas with transitional
or pivotal phrases (“In any event,” “With that said,” “As I mentioned
elsewhere,” etc.) that help to keep the talk flowing. We also go off on
brief tangents before making our way back to the main topic, and
sometimes express ourselves in run-on sentences. While this is perfectly
natural in speech, it can be confusing and complex in written text.
Let’s strive for the perfect balance of simple yet professional writing.

Additional style bonus points
-----------------------------

-   Avoid double lines after paragraphs; this is a leftover from the age
    of typewriters and can create “rivers” of white space.
-   Capitalize the first word of each item in a bulleted list,
    especially if items include a verb form (this list is an example!). 
    Punctuate uniformly.
-   Capitalize the first word of headings and subheadings; lower case
    all others.

Format your Markdown nicely
-----------------------

We need to be able to process the content from our Jekyll-based
website and turn it into various formats like LaTeX and EPUB.  Our
automated tools work much better if pages are formatted with simple
and uniform markup. Some key points:

-   Mark up your links: use [The Peeragogy
    Handbook](http://peeragogy.org) instead of <http://peeragogy.org>. 
    It’s best if the link text is somewhat descriptive.
-   Use a numbered list to format your references (see [Convening a
    Group](http://peeragogy.org/convening-a-group/) for one example of
    an article that gets this right!)
- Use hashtags or similar to mark up sections, not **bold** text.  If
    you use bold or italics in your paragraphs, you
    should **check** that the markup *is actually correct*. It should
    exactly surround the words that you’re marking up – `<em>like
    this</em>` – and it should not include extra spaces around marked
    up words – `<em> NOT like this </em>.`
